maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.IOExceptionToJacksonException,Replace `IOException` with `JacksonException` in catch clauses,"In Jackson 3, `ObjectMapper` and related classes no longer throw `IOException`. This recipe replaces `catch (IOException e)` with `catch (JacksonException e)` when the try block contains Jackson API calls. When the try block also contains non-Jackson code that throws `IOException`, an additional `catch (JacksonException e)` block is added before the existing `IOException` catch.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.Jackson3JsonNodeFieldIterators,Migrate `JSONNode` field iterator for Jackson 3,`JSONNode` fields are using `Collections` instead of `Iterator` singe Jackson 3. To mimic Jackson 2s behavior an additional call to `Collection#iterator()`is needed.,1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.RemoveBuiltInModuleRegistrations,Remove registrations of modules built-in to Jackson 3,"In Jackson 3, `ParameterNamesModule`, `Jdk8Module`, and `JavaTimeModule` are built into `jackson-databind` and no longer need to be registered manually. This recipe removes `ObjectMapper.registerModule()` and `MapperBuilder.addModule()` calls for these modules.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.RemoveRedundantFeatureFlags,Remove redundant Jackson 3 feature flag configurations,"Remove `ObjectMapper` feature flag configurations that set values to their new Jackson 3 defaults. For example, `disable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)` and `configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false)` are redundant since this is now disabled by default in Jackson 3.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,"[{""name"":""featureName"",""type"":""String"",""displayName"":""Feature name"",""description"":""The fully qualified feature flag name that has a new default in Jackson 3.

maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.ReplaceJsonIgnoreWithJsonSetter,Replace `@JsonIgnore` with `@JsonSetter` on empty collection fields,"In Jackson 3, `@JsonIgnore` on fields initialized with empty collections causes the field value to become `null` instead of maintaining the empty collection. This recipe replaces `@JsonIgnore` with `@JsonSetter(nulls = Nulls.AS_EMPTY)` on `Map` and `Collection` fields that have an empty collection initializer.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.ReplaceStreamWriteCapability,Replace removed `JsonGenerator` capability methods with `StreamWriteCapability`,"In Jackson 3, `JsonGenerator.canWriteBinaryNatively()` and `canWriteFormattedNumbers()` were removed and replaced with the `StreamWriteCapability` enum. This recipe updates these method calls to use `getWriteCapabilities().isEnabled(StreamWriteCapability.*)` instead.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.SimplifyJacksonExceptionCatch,Simplify catch clauses for Jackson exceptions,"In Jackson 3, `JacksonException` and its subtypes extend `RuntimeException`. This recipe simplifies multi-catch clauses by removing Jackson exception types when `RuntimeException` is also caught, since catching both is redundant. For example, `catch (JacksonException | RuntimeException e)` becomes `catch (RuntimeException e)`.",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,

maven,org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-jackson,org.openrewrite.java.jackson.UseModernDateTimeSerialization,Use modern date/time serialization defaults,"Remove redundant `@JsonFormat` annotations on `java.time` types that specify ISO-8601 patterns, as Jackson 3 uses ISO-8601 as the default format (with `WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS` now disabled by default).",1,,Jackson,Java,,Recipes to perform [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) migration tasks.,Basic building blocks for transforming Java code.,
